							<h2>Why Terrace Water Proofing is Essential</h2>
							<p>In Hyderabad's climate, with heavy monsoon rains and intense heat, terrace water proofing is crucial for protecting your home. Water damage can lead to structural issues, mold growth, and costly repairs. Proper water proofing creates a barrier that prevents water from seeping into your building structure.</p>

							<h2>Common Water Proofing Problems</h2>
							<p>Terrace water proofing issues manifest in various ways:</p>
							<div style={{margin: '30px 0', textAlign: 'center'}}>
								<img 
									src="/images/hero-bg.webp" 
									alt="Water proofing problems" 
									style={{maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', borderRadius: '12px', boxShadow: '0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'}}
									loading="lazy"
								/>
							</div>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Leakage:</strong> Water seeping through cracks and joints</li>
								<li><strong>Dampness:</strong> Moisture accumulation causing paint peeling</li>
								<li><strong>Structural Damage:</strong> Cracks in walls and ceilings</li>
								<li><strong>Mold Growth:</strong> Health hazards from moisture</li>
								<li><strong>Electrical Issues:</strong> Water damage to electrical systems</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Water Proofing Methods</h2>
							
							<h3>1. Polyurethane Coating</h3>
							<p>Flexible, durable coating that expands and contracts with temperature changes. Ideal for Hyderabad's climate with extreme temperature variations.</p>

							<h3>2. Bituminous Coating</h3>
							<p>Asphalt-based coating providing excellent water resistance. Cost-effective solution for large terrace areas.</p>

							<h3>3. Cementitious Water Proofing</h3>
							<p>Easy to apply, forms a rigid waterproof barrier. Suitable for areas that won't experience movement.</p>

							<h3>4. Liquid Waterproofing Membrane</h3>
							<p>Seamless, flexible membrane that forms a continuous barrier. Excellent for complex terrace shapes and details.</p>

							<h3>5. EPDM Rubber Membrane</h3>
							<p>Durable synthetic rubber membrane with excellent weather resistance. Long-lasting solution for flat terraces.</p>
