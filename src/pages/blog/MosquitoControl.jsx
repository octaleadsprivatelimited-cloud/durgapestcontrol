							<h2>The Mosquito Threat</h2>
							<p>Mosquitoes are more than just annoying pests—they're vectors for serious diseases. In Hyderabad and surrounding areas, mosquitoes can transmit dengue, malaria, chikungunya, and other illnesses. Effective mosquito control is essential for protecting your family's health.</p>

							<h2>Diseases Transmitted by Mosquitoes</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Dengue:</strong> High fever, severe headache, joint pain</li>
								<li><strong>Malaria:</strong> Fever, chills, flu-like symptoms</li>
								<li><strong>Chikungunya:</strong> Fever and severe joint pain</li>
								<li><strong>Zika Virus:</strong> Mild symptoms but serious for pregnant women</li>
								<li><strong>Japanese Encephalitis:</strong> Brain inflammation</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Mosquito Breeding Sites</h2>
							<p>Mosquitoes breed in standing water. Common breeding sites include:</p>
							<div style={{margin: '30px 0', textAlign: 'center'}}>
								<img 
									src="/images/MOSQUITO CONTROL1.webp" 
									alt="Mosquito control and prevention" 
									style={{maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', borderRadius: '12px', boxShadow: '0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'}}
									loading="lazy"
								/>
							</div>
							<ul>
								<li>Water-filled containers (buckets, pots, tires)</li>
								<li>Clogged gutters and drains</li>
								<li>Bird baths and fountains</li>
								<li>Puddles and stagnant water</li>
								<li>Plant saucers and flower pots</li>
								<li>Construction sites with water accumulation</li>
								<li>Swimming pools (if not maintained)</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Professional Mosquito Control Methods</h2>
							
							<h3>1. Fogging</h3>
							<p>Ultra-low volume (ULV) fogging disperses insecticide as fine mist, reaching mosquitoes in their hiding places. Effective for immediate reduction of adult mosquito populations.</p>

							<h3>2. Larviciding</h3>
							<p>Treatment of breeding sites with larvicides prevents mosquito larvae from developing into adults. This is the most effective long-term control method.</p>

							<h3>3. Residual Spraying</h3>
							<p>Application of long-lasting insecticides to walls, vegetation, and other surfaces where mosquitoes rest.</p>

							<h3>4. Source Reduction</h3>
							<p>Elimination or treatment of breeding sites to prevent mosquito reproduction.</p>

							<h2>Prevention Tips</h2>
							<p>Reduce mosquito populations around your property:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Eliminate Standing Water:</strong> Empty containers, clean gutters, fix leaks</li>
								<li><strong>Maintain Pools:</strong> Keep swimming pools chlorinated and covered when not in use</li>
								<li><strong>Use Screens:</strong> Install window and door screens</li>
								<li><strong>Wear Protective Clothing:</strong> Long sleeves and pants during peak mosquito hours</li>
								<li><strong>Use Repellents:</strong> Apply EPA-approved mosquito repellents</li>
								<li><strong>Trim Vegetation:</strong> Keep grass and shrubs trimmed to reduce resting areas</li>
								<li><strong>Install Fans:</strong> Mosquitoes are weak fliers—fans help keep them away</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>When to Call Professionals</h2>
							<p>Professional mosquito control is recommended when:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Mosquito populations are high</li>
								<li>Disease outbreaks occur in your area</li>

								<li>You're hosting outdoor events</li>
								<li>You have large properties or multiple breeding sites</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Mosquito Control Schedule</h2>
							<p>Effective mosquito control requires regular treatment:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Pre-Monsoon:</strong> Treatment before rainy season</li>
								<li><strong>During Monsoon:</strong> Regular fogging and larviciding</li>
								<li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> Cleanup and continued treatment</li>
								<li><strong>Year-Round:</strong> Maintenance in areas with year-round mosquito activity</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Community Mosquito Control</h2>

							<ul>
								<li>Coordinate with neighbors</li>
								<li>Report standing water to authorities</li>
								<li>Participate in community fogging programs</li>
